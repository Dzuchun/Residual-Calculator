# Residual-Calculator
Simple utillity that uses Cauhy integral formula to evaluate residual of a complex-valued function

There is a code at net.sourceforge.bracer pacage I do not own. It was downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/bracer/ and changed, so it would work (original project is from 2012)

Bracer uses Apahe-Math, so I used it partially as well.
